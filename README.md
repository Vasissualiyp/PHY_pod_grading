# PHY_pod_grading
A small script that helps me to grade the students in their respective pods.
I use this for PHY courses at the Unviersity of Toronto.
It does a very simple thing: Takes an excel spreadsheet with 2 sheets: Pods and Marks.
The first sheet contains assignment of students to their pods, as well as their attendance.
The second sheet contains the marks for the entire pod.
The code then takes the marks of pods and students' attendance into consideration, and makes it into a nice ordered spreadsheet that is easy to put into quercus (grading website powered by canvas).
In the future, I am planning to automate uploading of marks to quercus so that everything is completely automatic.
